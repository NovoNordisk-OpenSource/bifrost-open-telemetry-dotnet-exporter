# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
We do our best to make sure that everything we do is secure, but if we missed something please let us know.

Use [GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) if you find a vulnerability in this repository. You do that by selecting the Security tab here in GitHub and then click the "Report a vulnerability" button.
